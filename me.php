    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy; font-size: 40px">ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Chloe.</span><br></br>
    
    Iâ€™m a junior at <a href='https://www.cornell.edu/'>Cornell University</a> studying Information Science, with concentrations in User Experience and Data Science, and Business. 
    <br></br>I am passionate about solving problems to create meaningful change for individuals and organizations via digital platforms. 
    On campus, I am involved with <a href='https://www.cornellappdev.com/'>AppDev</a>, the <a href="https://milstein-program.as.cornell.edu/">Milstein Program in Technology and Humanity</a>, 
    and the <a href='https://www.cornellswib.com/'>Society for Women in Business</a>.
    In my free time, I enjoy exercising, listening to music, trying new restaurants in Ithaca, and traveling.</p>

<p> My journey into product began with my internship at <a href='https://www.catch-nyc.com/'>Catch New York</a> last summer. 
    I found myself fascinated by understanding the consumer and creating products and campaigns that align with the needs of the target audience.
    I have continued to foster my passion for strategizing and defining product vision by working with <a href='https://simplifed.us/'>SimpliFed</a>, 
    a startup in the healthcare space, this past semester.
<br></br>I love to talking to new people and learning about their projects and experiences. If you would like to contact me, feel free to send me an email at cek223@cornell.edu or add me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-kanders-6b390a184/'>LinkedIn</a>.</p>
