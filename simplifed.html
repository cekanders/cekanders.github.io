        <p>SUMMARY</p>
    </div>

    <div class='linked'>
        <p>I worked as a Product Management intern for <a href='https://simplifed.us/'>SimpliFed</a>, a start up in the virtual lactation space, to improve the overall user experience and user engagement of the site. 
        SimpliFed is a HIPPA-compliant video service platform that connects new moms with IBCLCs, International Board Certified Lactation Consultants. 
        During my internship, I mapped out objectives and key results and collaborated with design and development teams to update web pages.
        In addition, I met virutally with new moms to conduct user research and usability testing to understand their needs and pain-points with the current product.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tag">
        <p>THE PROBLEM</p>
    </div>
    <p>New moms often don't know where to look for advice during their pregnancy or the birth of their child and may not be aware of helpful resources.
    While many turn to family and friends for guidance, a professional opinion can provide personalized, crucial information as well as up-to-date industry solutions.
    Because of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional in-person appointments have been limited and less accessible which creates the need for an online platform. </p> 

    <div class="tag">
        <p>THE SOLUTION</p>
    </div>
    <p>In order to provide necessary expertise to new moms, SimpliFed connects new moms with IBCLCs who can provide support and guidance during preganancy and the first months of the child's life.
    In addition, SimpliFed is a virtual platform, making its service accessible to new moms who are often on the go, whenever and wherever. </p>

    <p>IMPROVING UX</p>
    </div>

    <p>Based on the user research and usability testing, my team and I made several changes to
    improve the user experience of the site. A drop-dwon menu with subpages was added to improve 
    the SEO of the site. In addition, four pages were redesigned: Schedule, Telelactation, Breastfeeding 
    Complications, and Breastfeeding Support.</p>
    
    <div class="title2">
    <p>Schedule Page</p>
    </div>

    <div class='space'></div>
    <div class='list_style'>
        <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Medium">Original Design</p>
    </div>

    <img class='img_paddingb' src='images/org_schedule.png' alt='Original Schedule'>
    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Medium">Pain-point #1</span> - Lack of text information when the displayed to the user when he/she 
    first opens the page</p>

    <div class='row2'></div>
    <img class='img_paddingb' src='images/org_schedule2.png' alt='Original Schedule 2'>
    <div class='list_style'>
        <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Medium">Pain-point #2</span> - The Request Appointment button takes the users to the same pop-up 
        window in Simple Practice, a HIPPA compliant video-calling platform, to schedule an appointment</p>
    </div>  

    <div class='space'></div>
    <div class='list_style'>
        <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Medium">On-Demand Call Feature Sketches</p></span>
    </div>
    <div class='row'>
        <div>
            <img class='img_paddingr' src='images/sketch1.jpg' alt='Sketch 1'>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img class='img_paddingr' src='images/sketch2.jpg' alt='Sketch 2'>

            <img class='img_paddingr' src='images/sketch3.jpg' alt='Sketch 3'>
        </div>
    </div>  

    <p>In addition to creating solutions to the two pain-points listed above, my team and I 
        added a fourth schedule type option to implement an On-Demand calling feature that 
        will be available shortly. I designed different user flows, placing the call to action
        in two different locations. In the first flow, the user is presented with two options 
        on the homepage: Schedule an Appointment or Talk to a Consultant. In the second flow,
        the user is not presented with the option to talk to a consultant on demand until he/she 
        clicks on the Schedule an Appointment page. Ultimately, my team and I decided to go with 
        the second flow because in this flow, the user must view all available options before making
        a decision. This provides the user with more information and prevents them from potenitally
        missing an option that works better for them.
    </p>

    <div class='row2'></div>
    <div class='list_style'>
        <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Medium">Final Implementation</p></span>
</div>
    <img class='img_paddingb' src='images/final_schedule1.png' alt='Final Schedule 1'>
    <p>In the final implementation of the schedule page, we decreased the height of
        the banner decreased (which becomes consistent across all pages) in order to provide
        more context for the user. In addition, we added an Available Schedule Options header 
        which provides more details about the content of the page for the user.</p>
    <div class='row2'></div>

    <img class='img_paddingb' src='images/final_schedule2.png' alt='Final Schedule 2'>
    <p>We decided to go with the second option with the four boxes displayed vertically in order to 
        demonstrate equality between all the options. In our usability testing, we found that user
        were confused about why there were three separate buttons that lead to the same pop-up box
        appearing on the screen once clicked on. The request appointment button applies 
        to the three types of appointments because of the pop-up box in Simple Practice, so we 
        decided to only include one button instead of three separate buttons leading to the same
        link to avoid confusion for the user.</p>
    <div class='row2'></div>

    <img class='img_paddingb' src='images/final_schedule3.png' alt='Final Schedule 3'>
    <p>In our usability testing, we found that users wanted more information about the people 
        they are signing up for appointments with on the Schedule page so we included a section 
        called Our IBCLCs to help users understand who they will be talking to.

    that some sections are more important than others.</p>

    <p>In the redesign of the Why Should I Use Telelactation Section, several changes were made to 
        improve the readability of the text. We decided to use columns instead of rows to signify
        equality across all sub-sections and decrease the width of the text across the page. 
        In addition, we created titles to emphasize key points of each box.

    <p>CONCLUSION</p>
    </div>
    <p>I enjoyed working collaboratively with the design and development teams as well as Andrea 
    and the rest of the SimpliFed team to help enhance the site. Reflecting on my research, I 
    think that the usability testing was the most useful part of the research, resulting in
    actionables I could take to improve the site. However, understanding the users' motivations, 
    desires and challenges was essential in thinking about the product vision and the purpose of 
    the On-Demand calling feature. I think that I could have spent more time in understanding the 
    users and brainstorming other potential features to improve their experience on the site. 
    <br></br>
    In terms of the user interface designs, I think much progress was made in improving the 
    readability and making content more accessible to the users, as indicated by the user research.
    As a product management intern, I think I should have investigated metrics more, specifically
    tracking and analyzing metrics relating to calls to action on the page such as when the user 
    clicks on a button or signs up for an appointment, as those metrics would be more telling of 
    our progress and what needs improvement. Overall, my favorite part of the experience was 
    acting as the intermediary between the design and development teams and planning our goals 
    and course of action to achieve them. I'm excited to see how SimpliFed evolves in the future!
