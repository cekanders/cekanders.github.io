        <p>SUMMARY</p>
    </div>

    <p>I worked to design onboarding email templates for Blue Foundry Bank, a regional bank based in New Jersey.
        Blue Foundry Bank is a bank targeting "movers and shakers," offering personal banking and business banking plans.
        In this process, I conducted market research to understand the customers and their needs, created a customer journey map and iterated on template designs for two different products.
        We developed templates for the AxisChecking account (personal) as well as Blue Carbon banking (business). 
        More details to come.</p>
