    <div class='linked'>
        <p><a href='https://www.sage-sound.com'>Sage and Sound</a> is a health and wellness community based in NYC that curates the worldâ€™s 
        best wellness products and vendors. The Study is a virtual and physical space offering seminars, 
        speaker series from leaders in the industry, and events. My team and I worked to design and 
        develop a site for Sage and Sound. I focused on designing the blog as well as developing a 
        pricing strategy for hosting an online video streaming platform on The Study.</p>

        <p>THE PROBLEM</p>
    </div>

    <p>In their daily busy lives, people often prioritize other aspects of their lives over 
    wellness which can result in one becoming out of touch with themselves and their mental and 
    physical health. Health-concious individuals in NYC lack a space and community to pursue
    their wellness journey and can feel lost exploring different options.</p>

    <div class="tag">
        <p>THE SOLUTION</p>
    </div>

    <p>Sage and Sound seeks to streamline one's wellness journey by providing guidance from
    experts and curating the products and vendors all under one roof. This increases accessibility
    to valuable health and wellness information for people who want to explore these areas.</p>

        <p>BLOG DESIGNS</p>
    </div>

    <p>I speadheaded the blog design initiative by ideating different user flows and brainstorming ways 
    to present information to readers. I came up with several different designs for different pages such as the 
    Landing Page, Filter Page, News, Events, and Posts. In this process, I first created wireframes 
    to understand the information architecture of the site. Once my team and I selected which wireframes 
    we wanted to move forward with, I worked with the visual designer to translate the Sage and Sound design system
    and brand onto these wireframes.</p>

        <p>INSPIRATION</p>
    </div>

    <p>I first researched different health and wellness blogs such as the Chill Times, Babe by Hatch, Into the Gloss,
    and Hello Glow for inspiration and to understand the ways in which these successful interfaces are structured.
    I found that many sites featured one story and used large images to draw the reader's attention. 
    I was particularly inspired by the scrolling design of the Babe by Hatch blog.</p>

        <p>WIREFRAMES</p>
    </div>

    <p>One challenge that I had to overcome while designing the wireframes for the landing page was 
    figuring out a way to categorize content. The copywriter created four different categories of 
    content which I considered separating into different pages which could be accessed by a dropdown subnavigation bar on the home page (Option 1) or 
    placing this secondary navigation bar on the blog page (Option 2). Because I wanted the user to explore all four 
    categories, I decided that a central landing page called Featured with a secondary nav bar would 
    increase engagement as this page would display popular articles from each category.
    However, a second horizontal nav bar directly below the first could be overwhelming for users. As a result, I 
    decided on placing a vertical nav bar on the left hand side next to a featured article to ensure its 
    prominence without being too overbearing.</p>

    <div class='space'></div>

    <div class='row'>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Option 1</span>
            <img class='img_cap' src="images/landing.png" alt="Landing 1" />
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Option 2</span>
            <img class='img_cap' src="images/landing1.png" alt="Landing 1" />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Another big decision that I had to make was how much content would be presented to the reader.
    After much deliberation, I decided that one large story would be presented to the viewer 
    upon entering the site and as they scrolled down, the text would transition into the next article
    in the final wireframe design. I was mainly inspired by Babe by Hatch website design. One reason why I made this decision was due to the nature and size of
    the platform. Because Sage and Sound is new, we didn't have too much content for the site at that time so
    it made sense to spread the content out instead of presenting everything on one page.</p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <img class='img_home' src="images/landing2.png" alt="Landing 2" />

    <p>After a user scrolls through all of the featured articles, he/she is introduced 
    to the four categories of content and can browse through available articles in that category on the featured
    page or visit the category page. Through several iterations, I decided on presenting each category in a horiztonal row carousel. 
    By presenting a few articles for each category on the featured page, the user can is exposed to all of the categories before choosing which one he/she is most interested in.
    I also had to consider how much information should be presented on each article such as title, type 
    of content, author, date, etc. I decided to go with less information, only including the title and article 
    type to maintain the viewer's focus. Finally, I had to consider the placement and number of 
    email newsletter sign up boxes. Instead of having a pop-up box which could be potentially jarring
    and lack context, I decided on placing one after the user has been introduced to the content of the 
    blog as well as one in the footer of the page.</p>

    <div class="tag">
        <p>FINAL DESIGN</p>
    </div>
    <p>After presenting the wireframes to our client and gaining their approval, we proceeded to 
    move forward with integrating the visual designs before the website was coded and launched. 
    Slight changes and additions have been made since these designs were created.</p>
    <div class='space'></div>

    <img class='img_home' src="images/final_landing_ss.png" alt="Final Landing" />
    <p>The visual designer and I incorporated key elements from the design system 
    such as the color palette, font system, large blobs, images, and thin sage renderings.</p>

    <div class="tag">
        <p>WIREFRAMES</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>For each content category, we created a landing page with information about the category 
    and articles. This page can be accessed by either the side navigation bar on the homepage 
    or the horizontal carousel. While designing the wireframes for this page, I had to consider 
    how many articles the viewer should be presented with and how much information about 
    the article would be presented.</p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <img class='img_home' src="images/filter_ss.png" alt="Filter Page" />

    <div class="tag">
        <p>FINAL DESIGN</p>
    </div>
    <p>In the final designs, my team and I decided on rows with two articles because of the 
    amount of content available on the site. We also decided to limit the amount of information 
    available to the viewer to just the title and a quick article preview.</p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <img class='img_home' src="images/filter_final.png" alt="Filter Page" />

    <p>In addition, certain pages required a different design tailored to the content on the page. 
    For example, Sage Picks are monthly recommendation articles. I felt that including the month 
    of the article was essential to the information architecture of the page while a preview of 
    the article was less important. As a result, the following design was developed.</p>

        <p>WIREFRAMES</p>
    </div>
    <p>My team and I designed different post pages depending on the type of content on the page. 
    For the article page, we had to consider the placement of the title and images, block quotes, headers, 
    and bullets. Each post concludes with a suggested posts horizontal carousel at the bottom of the 
    page to encourage users to explore other articles that may be of interest to them.</p>

    <div class="tag">

    </div>
    <p>In the final article design, my team and I iterated on the size and placement of 
    the image and incorporated larger text to summarize the article. We ultimately decided 
    on center-aligning the text to increase readability and integrated the brand colors 
    and fonts.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In addition to the plain text article, my team and I explored different information
    architecture for video and podcast content. For the video page, we had to take different 
    states into account such as paused and playing as well as consider 
    which additional information was essential to include. 
    In designing the podcast page, we had to decide how we wanted to include images.</p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <div class='row'>
        <div>
            <img class='img_home' src="images/video.png" alt="Video" />

    </div>

    <div class="tag">
        <p>FINAL DESIGN</p>
    </div>
    <p>Finally, different categories of content could have tailored designs to the text in the article. 
    For example, the AM/PM category goes through the daily routine of a wellness expert, listing 
    products and routines they employ throughout their day. Because the content is divided into two distinct 
    sections - AM and PM - we decided to tailor the designs to visually represent this. 
    The orange color in the background of AM represents the sun rising in the morning while the 
    light pink color in the background of PM represents the sun setting in the evening. Within 
    these two categories, the content is broken down into three more categories: mind, body, and soul.
    We experimented with labeling these categories vertically and horizontally and ultimately decided on 
    horizontal labels above the text. As the user scrolls down, the background color changes 
    once the user finishes reading the AM section. </p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <div class='row'>
        <div>
            <img class='img_home' src="images/am.png" alt="AM" />
        </div>

        <div>
            <img class='img_home' src="images/pm.png" alt="PM" />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>After reading the article, the user may be interested in purchasing the items that 
    were mentioned in the article. To make this easier for them, I designed a Shopping List 
    at the bottom of the article. The list clearly breaks up the AM and PM sections and links 
    the products in an orderly fashion. While working on these designs, I had to consider 
    how I would label the mind, body, and soul sections.</p>

        <p>FINAL DESIGN</p>
    </div>
    <p>In addition to creating wireframes and final designs for the desktop version of the site,
    my team and I designed mobile versions. One challenge I faced while working on these 
    designs was how to implement the secondary navigation bar. From my inspiration, I decided 
    that a hamburger menu for the primary navigation bar would allow for room for a horizontal 
    secondary navigation bar across the top of the page. I also reconsidered how much information 
    I would provide about the articles on the landing page as a phone screen is much smaller.</p>

        <p>CONTEXT</p>
    </div>
    <P>The Study offers resources for those who want to learn more about their health and wellness 
    through classes and community discussions. Because of the pandemic, Sage and Sound had to delay 
    their in-person opening. As a result, we worked to create a virtual study with classes online. 
    One question we asked ourselves was: <span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">How 
    could we create a sense of community online?</span></p>
    <div class="tag">
        <p>LIVESTREAMING COSTS</p>
    </div>
    <p>In order to facilitate a sense of community during online classes, we need to build out 
    an interactive video platform by using several services. From a strategic persepctive, I had
    to think about how we could minimize our costs while finding an effective video infrastructure.
    We decided to go with Mux to build live videos but had to approximate costs based on factors such 
    as video duration, videos/month, monthly view count, and watch time to find total costs. 
    In addition, we needed to employ a server, streaming software, and chat service. We used 
    the folowing equation to calculate total costs: </p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Total Cost = Mux + Netlify Server ($99) + Streaming Software + Chat Service</span></p>

    <div class="tag">
        <p>MUX SCENARIOS</p>
    </div>
    <p>Based on the following scenarios, I created a spreadsheet to figure out how we could optimize 
    our costs on Mux, while taking our needs into consideration.</p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Duration (minutes)</span></p>
    <p>30, 45, 60, 90</p>
    <div class='space'></div>

    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Videos/Month</span></p>
    <p>5, 15, 30, 60</p>
    <div class='space'></div>

    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Monthly View Count</span></p>
    <p>50, 1,500, 5,000</p>
    <div class='space'></div>
    <p><span style="font-family: Avenir Heavy, sans-serif">Watch Time (percentage)</span></p>
    <p>30%, 50%, 90%, 100%</p>

    <div class='space'></div>
    <img class='img_home' src="images/cost_estimator.png" alt="Cost Estimator" />

    <p>From this spreadsheet, I was able to find the lowest and highest possible total cost/stream, 
    $0.15 and $21.31, respectively. This information was used to make decisions regarding 
    the streaming software and chat service selected as well as a plan on Mux.</p>

    <div class="tag">
        <p>CONCLUSION</p>
    </div>
    <p>I really enjoyed this project as someone who is passionate about health and wellness myself. 
    Taking owernship of the blog designs allowed me to strengthen my skills in wireframing. I thought 
    that working on the layout of the blog was a unique experience and looking at other blogs 
    for inspiration was essential. I also found working on the pricing strategy of the livestreaming 
    platform and learning about how video livestreaming works to be really valuable. On this project, I had the opportunity to participate in meetings 
    with the client and offer my feedback and opinion which was exciting and I can't wait to see how 
    this brand takes off in person.</p>
